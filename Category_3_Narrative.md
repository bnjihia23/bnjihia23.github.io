# Category 3  Narrative

## 1.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I chose for the databases category is the Animal Shelter Dashboard application I originally developed in CS 320. The dashboard allows users to filter, search, and visualize animal outcome data from the Austin Animal Center. The original version relied solely on MongoDB for data storage and querying. It was built to demonstrate CRUD operations and full-stack integration using Python, Dash, and a NoSQL database.

## 2.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I chose this artifact because it presented an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to design data-driven applications and integrate backend data sources with an interactive front-end dashboard. During my enhancement of this artifact, I was able to showcase ETL scripting, secure credential management, SQL query optimization, and front-end data visualization using the Dash framework.  
The biggest improvement I made I was moving the data layer over to MySQL. I originally planned to use both MongoDB and MySQL together, but my old MongoDB environment was wiped after the course ended. This turned out to be a non-issue since the dataset is static and the dashboard is designed for analytics. As a result, the MySQL ended up being the better fit for the project. I went on to build a proper relational schema, write a Python ETL script (load_animals.py) that loads all the shelter records into the database, and create indexes to make the filtering faster. I also rewrote the data layer (animal_shelter.py) to use parameterized MySQL queries instead of MongoDB. To improve security, I created a separate non-root database user with limited permissions to view the dashboard. These enhancements worked together to make to program run faster and behave more like a professional analytics application.  

## 3.	Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
Yes, my enhancement fully meets the course outcome I outlined in Module One. It demonstrates outcome 3 by integrating professional tools like MySQL, Python’s MySQL connector, and Dash. It also satisfies outcome 5 through the implementation of security practices such as the principle of least privilege, the creation of a restricted MySQL user account, and the use of .env variables to protect credentials.  

## 4.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn, and what challenges did you face? 
Working on this enhancement taught me a lot about how different databases behave. When I originally built this artifact, I didn’t consider the effect each could have on the performance of the application. Rebuilding the backend from scratch helped me to realize how important it is to choose the right database technology for the workload. For example, MongoDB excels at flexible document storage, but MySQL is much better for filtering, grouping, sorting, and other analytical tasks.  
One challenge I faced was dealing with the dataset itself. Some of the fields weren’t consistent and required some cleanup before being loaded into MySQL. Furthermore, losing access to the original environment in Apporto forced me to rethink how the system should be designed. At first, that felt like a setback, but it actually pushed me toward a cleaner and more efficient solution. Rebuilding the data layer from scratch gave me the chance to rethink my database structure and write more reliable code. Overall, this enhancement helped strengthen my understanding of SQL and showed me that starting over can sometimes be a blessing in disguise.
