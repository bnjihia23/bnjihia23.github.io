# Professional Self-Assessment
	
	When I first enrolled in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I did not have a clear idea of where I wanted to end up professionally. I knew I was interested in technology and the potential of AI systems, but I had little confidence in my technical skills and a poor understanding of software systems. Completing the program and finishing the capstone gave me the chance to evaluate how far I’ve come and present my work in a way that reflects my growth over the last 2 and a half years. 
	One of the most valuable parts of building my ePortfolio was realizing how much my skills developed from course to course. Early coursework focused mostly on fundamentals such as programming logic and debugging. As I progressed into higher-level courses, expectations rose as well. I was asked to think more carefully about structure, efficiency, and maintainability. Working through the capstone forced me to revisit earlier work and make deliberate improvements using the perspective and experience I’d accumulated. That process helped me understand the importance of clean design and constant improvement.  
Although much of the work in the CS program was completed independently, collaboration and communication were still emphasized throughout. Courses such as System Analysis and Design and Software Development Lifecycle required clear explanations of requirements and design choices. Even outside of course projects, completing things like discussion posts and design documents required me to communicate technical ideas clearly and professionally. These experiences improved my ability to explain complex concepts to non-technical audiences and reinforced the importance of stakeholder communication in real-world software development.
	My understanding of data structures and algorithms matured significantly over the course of the program. Courses like Discrete Mathematics and Data Structures and Algorithms challenged me to analyze time complexity, select appropriate data structures, and understand the impact of design choices on performance. These concepts carried directly into my capstone work, where I dealt with large datasets that required thoughtful backend design and clean logic.
	Software engineering and database concepts were a major area of growth for me. Courses such as Client/Server Development, Full Stack Development, and Structured Database Environments exposed me to building applications that rely on persistent data, backend logic, and clean interfaces between components. These courses helped me understand how poor structure in one part of a system can affect performance elsewhere. In my capstone, I revisited an earlier project and enhanced it by redesigning the data layer and improving query performance. Beyond the artifacts included in my ePortfolio, coursework involving concepts such as database modeling, query construction, and API integration helped reinforce the importance of thoughtful system architecture.
	Security is another area where my mindset and perspective evolved throughout the program. Courses such as Software Security and Software Testing and Automation pushed me to think proactively about how applications might fail or be vulnerable. During the capstone, I applied this mindset by managing configuration data responsibly, avoiding hard-coded credentials, and limiting database privileges. This security-first perspective is something I plan to carry forward into professional work.
	The artifacts included in this ePortfolio are purposefully curated to act as a cohesive demonstration of my progression throughout the CS program. Each artifact represents a different stage of my development and highlights a specific area of computer science, from software design and algorithms to databases and system architecture. Together as a whole, they illustrate my ability to analyze existing systems, improve them thoughtfully, and explain my decisions professionally. 
	Overall, I think the capstone was an effective way to transition from coursework to professional readiness. I now have a realistic understanding of both my strengths and the areas where I will continue to grow. I feel more confident in my technical abilities and more comfortable communicating about my work. This self-assessment serves as an introduction to the technical artifacts that follow and demonstrates my readiness to contribute in a professional software development environment.
