# Category 2 Narrative

## 1.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I chose for the algorithms and data structures category is the Advising Assistance program that I originally built in CS 300. The program was designed to read a CSV file of courses, load them into a data structure, and allow a user to print them alphabetically or look up a course individually. The original version stored all the courses in a singly linked list and used linear traversal to print the entire course list. The enhanced version replaces this approach with a more efficient binary search tree (BST). 

## 2.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I selected this artifact because it provided the opportunity to demonstrate how choosing the right data structure transforms the performance and design of a program. The original version was simple and functional, but it wasn’t the best for fast searching or printing a sorted list of courses. Looking up a single course meant walking the entire list, and printing courses alphabetically meant copying everything into a vector and sorting it every time.
For the enhancement, I redesigned the program to store courses in a BST instead of a linked list. This change improved the time complexity of searching for a course and printing the list in order. In the enhanced version, inserting a course and searching for a specific course both run in average O(log n) time instead of O(n). Printing the full course list is conducted through in-order traversal, which outputs courses alphabetically in O(n) without needing an extra sorting step. I also made other small improvements such as enhanced error handling when users enter invalid menu choices or incorrect filenames. These enhancements demonstrate that I understand the strengths and weaknesses of different data structures and can refactor existing code to use a more appropriate structure. 

## 3.	Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
In my initial enhancement plan, I planned to use this project to demonstrate the third course outcome, and I believe I met that goal. Switching from a linked list to a BST forced me to think, not only about how data gets stored, but also how the program performs when handling real user input. Implementing the BST required recursive insertion logic, a structured in-order traversal, and a more efficient search path. These changes allowed me to exhibit my growing understanding of how to weigh the trade-offs between different data structures and design a solution program around the appropriate one.

## 4.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn, and what challenges did you face? 
I think the most important lesson I learned from this artifact is how much the data structure impacts the entire design of a program. Moving from a linked list to a Binary Search Tree forced me to rewrite all of the program’s core operations. It also pushed me to carefully consider the time complexity of each operation and how well the structure supports real user inputs. A challenge I faced involved debugging and input validation. While I was testing my program, I realized that entering an invalid filename or menu choice caused the program to repeat prompts, get stuck, or misread the next input. Debugging this required me to dig into how cin behaves and how the input buffer works. To avoid this issue, I added clearer prompts, used cin.clear() and cin.ignore() to reset the input state, and rewrote the file-loading logic so users could retry without restarting the program. It took a bit of trial and error, but getting that right made the program feel more professional and also helped me understand how much effort goes into producing reliable code.
