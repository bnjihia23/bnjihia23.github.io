# Category 1 Narrative

## 1. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I chose for the software design and engineering category is the Travlr Getaways full-stack application I originally built in CS-465 last term. It uses Angular on the front end with a Node.js and Express backend connected to MongoDB. The application allows users to browse and manage trip listings, while administrators can add and update trips through an internal dashboard. 

## 2. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I selected this artifact because it’s the most complete system I developed during my time in the CS program. To improve it, I built a full mobile companion app that extends the system onto both iOS and Android platforms using React Native and Expo. Extending the original project into a mobile environment allowed me to showcase cross-platform development, API integration, and secure communication.
The enhancements I implemented improved the overall system significantly. I designed the mobile app to use the same Express API as the web version. Furthermore, I added a JWT-based authentication, so users can log in or register new accounts, and securely stored the token using AsyncStorage. I also built a dynamic trip list, detailed trip pages, and favorites saved locally on the device. Navigation is performed using a bottom tab bar and a stack navigator. To improve usability, I added a real-time search bar that filters trips by name, resort, or code, allowing users to quickly find the destination they’re interested in. Together, these additions showcase my ability to design and implement a mobile solution that integrates cleanly with an existing full-stack web system.

## 3. Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
The enhancements I implemented in this milestone met the outcomes I planned to address in the Module One assignment. My enhancement plan focused on outcomes 2, 4, and 5, and the mobile app reflects each of these goals clearly. I met outcome 2 by organizing the mobile interface into a clear, professional structure with tabs, stack navigation, and well-designed screens that communicate information clearly. I met outcome 4 by using modern tools like React Native, Expo Router, Context APIs, and dynamic routing to build the mobile app. Finally, I met outcome 5 by implementing secure authentication using JWTs, protecting network requests, and handling token persistence responsibly. The enhancements align with my original plan, and no updates to my outcome coverage are needed.

## 4. Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn, and what challenges did you face? 
Enhancing this project taught me how to adapt a full-stack web application into a mobile platform without sacrificing functionality and security. One of the main challenges I encountered during this process was learning how Expo Router handles navigation, especially with dynamic routes. Coming from Angular, the idea that the folder structure directly controls the navigation took some getting used to. I had to experiment a little to get the navigation setup I wanted. Another challenge I faced was implementing secure mobile authentication. On the web app, handling JWT was straightforward. In the mobile app, however, I needed to safely store tokens using AsyncStorage, reload them correctly when the app reopened, and make sure every protected API request included the right authorization header. I also had to approach the login and registration experience differently to make sure everything felt smooth and secure. Mobile-specific details like keyboard behavior and screen transitions added extra layers to consider. Working through these challenges helped me better understand how to design for a mobile platform and strengthened my ability to adapt a full-stack system so it works seamlessly across different devices.
